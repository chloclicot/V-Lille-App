The app follows a clean and modular architecture with a focus on separation of concerns.

- **Main:** The entry point of the app is `main.dart`. It initializes the app with a theme and sets up navigation.

    - **HomeScreen:** Displays the search bar, buttons for the map and favorites, and the closest station.
    - **StationWidget:** Represents individual stations in a list.
    - **MapScreen:** Displays the map with markers for each station.

- **Map Integration:** The app uses `flutter_map` package for rendering interactive maps and managing marker layers.

## Technologies Used
- **Flutter**: For building the app UI.
- **Provider**: State management solution for keeping track of stations and favorites.
- **flutter_map**: For rendering the map and placing interactive markers.
- **OpenStreetMap**: As the tile layer for the map.
- **V'Lille API**: To fetch real-time station data (number of bikes, parking spots, etc.).
